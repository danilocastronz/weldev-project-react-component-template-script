# React Component Template Script by Welcome, Developer

## Introduction

This app has the purpose of providing you with a Node.js script that creates a React component, its Storybook stories, and UI unit tests. Each file contains a start point that I believe you will find useful.

Hope you enjoy it (and save you some time), developers!

## Features

The following frameworks/libraries have been implemented:

1. [React](https://reactjs.org/)
2. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
3. [Storybook](https://material-ui.com/)
4. [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/react/)
5. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Install

To get up and running with the template, you just have to run the commands below:

```terminal
git clone https://github.com/danilocastronz/weldev-project-react-component-template-script
cd weldev-project-react-component-template-script
yarn install
```

## Creating React Components

To create a new React component using the template script, you just have to run the following command:

```terminal
yarn new-component <component-name>
```

There you go, that's it! A new folder with the React component, Storybook stories, and UI unit tests, has been created in the `src/components` folder üëå
